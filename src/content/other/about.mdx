# Building products that matter

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** passionate about turning ambitious ideas into real solutions. I thrive in early-stage environments where every decision shapes the product's future.

### What drives me

I love the unique challenges of startup life - wearing multiple hats, solving problems with limited resources, and building something from nothing. There's nothing quite like seeing users actually use something you built from scratch.

At **Zendot Technologies**, I've been focused on performance optimization and scaling challenges. Recently helped reduce deployment times by 80% and cut API response times from 300ms to under 100ms - the kind of improvements that directly impact user experience.

Previously, I architected and built **Alumnik** from the ground up - a complete connectivity platform that went from idea to beta. Working with a lean team taught me to make smart technology choices while keeping costs low through thoughtful AWS optimization.

### How I work

I believe great engineering isn't just about clean code - it's about understanding the business problem you're solving. Whether it's real-time systems, team mentoring, or figuring out product requirements on the fly, I focus on delivering what actually moves the needle.

I also contribute to open source projects like **KeyShade**, working on platform integrations and security systems. It keeps me sharp and connected to the broader developer community.

### What I'm looking for

I'm drawn to founders who are building something meaningful - whether that's solving a real problem or creating new opportunities. I work best in environments where I can have real impact on both the technical and product direction.
