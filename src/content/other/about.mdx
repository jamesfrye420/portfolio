# Ship Fast. Build Right. Scale Smart.

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** who turns startup ideas into production-ready products. Whether you need a founding engineer who can build your V1 product from scratch or a technical lead who can accelerate your MVP to market, I deliver results that matter.

### What I Bring to Your Startup

**ðŸš€ Speed to Market:** I ship working products, not excuses. Recently cut deployment times by 80% and reduced build cycles by 70% at Zendot Technologies.

**ðŸ’¡ Zero-to-One Builder:** Engineered **Alumnik**, architecting and shipping a complete connectivity platform from ideation to beta. Built with modern, fast-to-deploy stack (Next.js, NestJS, PostgreSQL) while keeping infrastructure costs minimal through smart AWS optimization.

**âš¡ Performance Obsessed:** Reduced API response times from 800ms to under 100ms. Improved page load speeds by 5x. Because every millisecond counts for user retention.

**ðŸŽ¯ Product-Minded Engineering:** I don't just write codeâ€”I understand business impact. Experience building real-time surveillance systems, managing cross-functional teams, and delivering features that users actually need.

### Why Founders Choose Me

- **I wear multiple hats:** From architecture decisions to mentoring juniors to shipping featuresâ€”I adapt to what your startup needs
- **I own problems end-to-end:** Give me a vague requirement, I'll deliver a working solution
- **I contribute beyond code:** Active open-source contributor (KeyShade) with experience in 3rd-party integrations and RBAC systems

### Track Record

**Current:** Full Stack Developer at Zendot Technologies  
**Previous:** Built Alumnik's entire platform architecture (Remote)  
**Open Source:** KeyShade contributor - Platform integrations & Security systems

### Let's Build Something Great

Looking for an engineer who can build fast and iterate early? Need someone who understands that in startups, shipping quickly matters as much as shipping quality?
